Here’s a thoughtfully curated romantic weekend itinerary for two in Paris—blending *fine dining* with *cultural richness*, all wrapped in a hint of Parisian charm and a dash of skepticism (as you might prefer).

---

## Friday Evening – Arrival & Elegant Introduction

* **Stay at the Ritz Paris**: Often hailed as the pinnacle of Parisian luxury, recent renovations boosted modern comfort while preserving legendary opulence. The hotel boasts Michelin-starred dining at *Espadon*, elegant cafés, cocktails at the famed Bar Hemingway, and even a cookery school if you want to add culinary romance([泰晤士报][1]).
* **Dinner Option**: Begin with a refined dinner at *L’Ambroisie*, a three-Michelin-starred gem known for flawless French cuisine in the historic Place des Vosges([维基百科][2]).

## Saturday – Culture, Cuisine & Cruise

**Morning:**

* Visit iconic art destinations like the **Louvre**, **Musée d’Orsay**, or the **Musée des Arts Décoratifs** for a refined start([澳大利亚人][3]).

**Lunch:**

* Enjoy a relaxed yet classic Parisian lunch in *Le Marais*—perhaps at **Chez Janou**, beloved for its Provencal charm and famous chocolate mousse([Vogue][4]).

**Afternoon:**

* Stroll through romantically cobblestoned streets—Latin Quarter or Île Saint‑Louis—and absorb Parisian ambience.
* Optional: stop at **Galerie Scène Ouverte** or **Mennour** to explore contemporary ceramics or eclectic international art([金融时报][5]).

**Evening:**

* Embark on a **Seine River dinner cruise** offering multi-course fare and live music—romantic, scenic, and undeniably Parisian([GetYourGuide][6]).

## Sunday – Culinary Heights & Romantic Wanderings

**Morning & Lunch:**

* Indulge at **Arpège**, Alain Passard’s iconic three-Michelin-star restaurant known for its vegetable-forward tasting menus—the first of its kind to go “almost vegan” while preserving haute-cuisine flair([维基百科][7]).

**Afternoon:**

* Share a leisurely stroll across **Pont Alexandre III**—a beautifully lit, romantic bridge where a kiss mid-crossing is practically tradition([gowithguide.com][8]).
* Explore **Le Train Bleu**, an opulent, historic restaurant inside Gare de Lyon—if you’d rather admire ambiance than dine again, its Belle Époque grandeur is worth the visit([维基百科][9]).

**Evening Departure:**

* If time allows, savor a final aperitif in the **Ritz’s Salon Proust** or a cocktail at **Bar Hemingway**—classic and memorable([泰晤士报][1]).

### A Hint of Doubt (Logical Checks)

* **Reservations required** at most Michelin-star restaurants like *L'Ambroisie* and *Arpège*—advance booking is essential.
* The “almost vegan” concept at **Arpège** is a bold shift—verify current menu options when booking([维基百科][10], [维基百科][2], [France Voyager][11], [泰晤士报][1], [维基百科][7], [gowithguide.com][8], [维基百科][9], [泰晤士报][12]).
* A Seine dinner cruise is romantic but touristy—make sure the particular boat offers the ambiance you expect([GetYourGuide][6]).
