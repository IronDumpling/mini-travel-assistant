Here's a solid 5‑day ski trip plan to the Swiss Alps in **February 2025** for a group of four. Conditions are typically excellent that month—cold, dry, and snowy—making it one of the best times to ski in Switzerland ([Club Med][1]).

### Suggested Itinerary: Swiss Rice into the Alps

#### **Base 1: Saas‑Fee (Days 1–2)**

* **Why?** Known as the "Pearl of the Alps," Saas‑Fee lies amid 13 peaks over 4,000 m and offers glacier skiing—excellent snow reliability ([维基百科][2]).
* **Day 1**: Arrive (likely via Geneva or Zürich → Visp → Saas‑Fee). Check-in, get fit with ski gear, explore the car‑free village, enjoy mountain views.
* **Day 2**: Ski the glacier-accessible terrain (beginners to advanced). Take the Metro Alpin, ski trails cover around 150 km with a vertical drop up to 1,800 m ([维基百科][2]).

#### **Base 2: Verbier (Days 3–5)**

* **Why?** Premier skiing in the “4 Vallées”—steep, extensive terrain and great off‑piste options ([维基百科][3]).
* **Day 3**: Transfer to Verbier (via train to Le Châble + cable car). Afternoon ski on Medran or Savoleyres.
* **Day 4**: Full day on varied slopes—including Mont Fort for breathtaking panoramic views. Group-specific options: groomed pistes or go all-out off‑piste (with a guide).
* **Day 5**: Morning ski; afterward enjoy resort village life—cafés, strolls, or an alpine lunch before departure.

### Travel & Logistics

* **Duration**: 5 days.
* **Transport**: Fly into Geneva or Zürich. Use Swiss Federal Rail and regional transfers to reach Saas‑Fee and Verbier.
* **Accommodation**: Look for family rooms or chalets—book well in advance (February is peak season) ([维基百科][3], [泰晤士报][4]).
* **Lift Passes**:

  * Saas‑Fee ski pass for glacier and local runs.
  * “4 Vallées” pass in Verbier gives access across multiple resorts ([维基百科][3]).
* **Dining & Apres**: Traditional Swiss fondue, local specialties—but note, dining is on the pricier side ([泰晤士报][4], [The Sun][5]).

### Why This Works

* **Snow reliability**: Glacier skiing in Saas‑Fee; high-altitude terrain in Verbier.
* **Variety**: Saas‑Fee’s family-friendly slopes vs Verbier’s demanding off-piste and renowned terrain.
* **Efficiency**: Two hubs minimize transfers and maximize ski time.

### Optional Alternatives or Add-ons

* **St. Moritz**: Ultra-luxurious and historic—excellent skiing at Corviglia but a bit out of the way for a 5-day loop ([Condé Nast Traveler][6]).
* **Andermatt**: Less crowded, snow-sure, and great for off‑piste—but more remote ([维基百科][7]).
