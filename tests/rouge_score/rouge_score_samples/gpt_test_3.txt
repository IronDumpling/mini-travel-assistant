## Logical, Focused 3‑Day Business Trip Itinerary: Tokyo (Shibuya & Shinjuku)

### Day 1 – Shibuya: Establish Rhythm and Brand Presence

* **Morning**
  Arrive and settle in. If you're staying near Shibuya, use this proximity to minimize transit time—logical efficiency saves energy.
  Explore **Shibuya Scramble Square** for its *Shibuya Sky* observation deck—great for inspired thinking or client impressions ([维基百科][1]).
* **Midday**
  Have lunch at one of the department store food floors or cafés near Shibuya Crossing—efficient, recognizable, likely reliable quality.
  **Visit Shibuya Crossing** briefly—iconic and visually impactful ([维基百科][2]).
* **Afternoon**
  Conduct business meetings—opt for modern, convenient meeting spaces possibly within or near Scramble Square linked to Shibuya Station.
* **Evening**
  If informal networking is appropriate, consider **Nonbei Yokocho** next to Shibuya Crossing, offering atmosphere with a hint of tradition ([Vogue][3]).

### Day 2 – Shinjuku: Deepen & Diversify Contacts

* **Morning**
  Head to **Shinjuku Southern Terrace**—a business-comfortable zone featuring cafés, restaurants, and a FedEx/Kinko’s for last-minute prep or coordination ([维基百科][4]).
* **Midday**
  Meet at a restaurant or lounge within the Odakyu Southern Tower for convenience, views, and a semi-formal setting.

  Revisit Shibuya or Shinjuku—whichever aligns better with follow-up meetings or client visits.
