Summer travelers - picnic at Champ de Mars (gourmet supplies from Laurent Dubois cheese shop).\n‚Ä¢ **Local Insights:** March√© des Enfants Rouges (closed Mondays) or Rue Cler market (best Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday mornings).\n‚Ä¢ **Avoid Crowds:** Sacr√©-C≈ìur sunrise visits (6AM) or consider lesser-known Butte Bergeyre viewpoint.\n\nüîç **Pro Tips:**\n‚Ä¢ Louvre free Sundays require 1PM arrival for shortest queues (skip line by entering via Carrousel du Louvre mall).\n‚Ä¢ V√©lib‚Äô bike-share: Download app beforehand and opt for electric bikes for hillier routes.\n‚Ä¢ Emergency number: 112 | Pharmacy lights: green=open, red=closed\n\nüéØ **Your Next Steps:**\n1. Book Eiffel Tower summit tickets immediately\n2. Make dining reservations via TheFork app\n3. Download Citymapper + V√©lib‚Äô apps tonight\n4. Pack comfortable walking shoes (Paris averages 8 miles/day)",

Check a 10-day forecast 48 hours before departure.\n‚Ä¢ **Local Payment Tips:** Carry small bills for tips and markets, and notify your bank of travel plans to avoid card blocks.\n‚Ä¢ **Emergency Preparedness:** Save local emergency numbers and your embassy‚Äôs contact in your phone.\n\nüåü **Personalized Touch:** If you‚Äôre exploring historic sites, consider early morning visits to avoid crowds and capture the best photos!",
