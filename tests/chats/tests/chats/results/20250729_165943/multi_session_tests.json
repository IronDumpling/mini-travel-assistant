          "content": "Thank you for your Southeast Asia travel inquiry! I'd love to help craft your perfect itinerary. Based on current trends and seasonal considerations, here's what I can recommend: 1) Thailand's beaches are ideal November-March, 2) Vietnam's cultural sites shine in spring (Feb-Apr), and 3) Bali offers great adventure activities year-round. To provide the best recommendations, could you share: - Exact travel dates (or season)? - Must-visit countries from [Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia]? - Top 2 interests from [beach relaxation, city exploration, cultural immersion, jungle trekking, food tourism]? - Budget per person (e.g., $50-100/day mid-range)? With these details, I'll create a customized 7-day sample itinerary with transportation tips and local insights.",
